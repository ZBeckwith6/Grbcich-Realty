Hello everyone, my name is Zach Beckwith and welcome to my website for Will Grbcich Real Estate.

My application allows Will to market himself to potential customers, provides them with vital information and resources and ultimately improving his business. While viewing the site, users will be able to learn more about Will's background and Hermann London (the company he works for), see which properties he has worked with or is currently working with, and the forms give them an easy way to get in contact with Will if they are interested in conducting business with him.

The main languages I used to create this site are HTML, CSS and Javascript. The first item I installed was Node.js in order to use the NPM package manager. From there I installed Lite-Server in order to have a live view of the site as I created it. Other packages installed include jQuery, Bootstrap, Bootstrap-Social and Font-Awesome.

If you have questions about the site or its code feel free to reach out to me via email @ zbeckwith6@gmail.com. Thank you and have a wonderful day!
